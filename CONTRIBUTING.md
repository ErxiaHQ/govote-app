# Contributing Guide
If you're reading this, it means you're interested in helping by contributing some of your time to the development of ths codebase and we're glad.

The frontend interface for govote was/is being built with [Preact](https://preactjs.com) using the [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli). Preact is a 3kb alternative to React and it was chosen because of its bundle size and because the `preact-cli` makes it easy to get started on a project easily. You can read more about Preact on the [website](https://preactjs.com).

## Submitting changes

Ensure that you fork out of the `development` branch and then you can branch out and create a new branch in the following manner:

`your initials` - `feature you're working on`

An example would be:

`ye-SEOoptimization`

When you're done, please send a GitHub Pull Request to govote-app with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 


Please follow the standard conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

Thanks!
