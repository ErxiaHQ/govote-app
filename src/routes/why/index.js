        <p>As new and younger voters, we’ll live with the decisions being made right now for the next few years. We need to be the ones making those decisions.</p>

        <p>Some of the decisions made in the past few years have affected some of us and our livelihoods.</p>

        <p>Vote the right people in so you know who to hold responsible when things are not working.</p>

        <p>What kind of future do you want to live in?</p>

        <p>What health care systems do you want in place?</p>

        <p>How do ensure security for everyone?</p>

        <p>How can we get our economy to better support SMEs and you?</p>

        <p>What do we need to change the education sector for good?</p>

        <p>It’s up to you to vote and decide! You owe it to yourself and your future. </p>

        <p>In the 2015 elections, only 33.7% (67,422,005) of the general population registered to vote (only 43.65% of the 67,422,005 eventually turned out to vote.) <em><a href='http://www.inecnigeria.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/summary-of-results.pdf' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>Source</a></em>.<br /> Let's increase that percentage for the upcoming election.</p>
